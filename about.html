    <p><b>Interviewee: Kevin Powell </b><br> Place of Employment: Youtube <br> Job Title: Front-End Web Developer</p>
    <p><b>What is your career name and where do you work?</b> <br> My official career title is front-end web developing and I currently work as an online resource to help grow the skills of aspiring web developers.</p>
    <p><b>Why did you choose your career?</b>  <br> I always enjoyed the design aspect of building things and since I was kind of a tech nerd growing up, designing things online using a website seemed like the best option for me. The prospect of being able to work from anywhere also appealed to me as a young web developer.</p>
    <p><b>Do you consider yourself good at your job?</b> <br>Absolutely not! There are far better front-end web developers than me who can do far cooler things than I can. The only reason as to why I think others would consider me good at my job is because I am better at explaining tough concepts for begginners. </p>
    <p><b>What is the worst aspect of your job?</b> <br>It would definitely be the fact that I have to sit around at a desk all day.</p>
    <p><b>What are some benefits of your job?</b> <br>The fact that I can work from home and that I am always in charge of my schedule.</p>
    <p><b>Do you need a college degree to become a front-end web developer?</b> <br> The coolest thing about computer programming in general is that most of the time you can learn everything you need to know from online tutorials. You don't need a college degree of any kind in order to land a job as a front-end web developer, which is why I think more students are looking into web development as a career.</p>
    <p><b>What do employers look for in a front-end web developer?</b> <br> Most of the time when you are being interviewed for a job relating to coding they are more interested in how well you can solve problems, not how well you know a coding language. Coding is all about expressing solutions to a problem and if you can show an interviewer that you know how to solve problems efficiently, they will be more likely to hire you.  </p>
    <p><b>What are some common misconceptions about your job?</b> <br> That you need to be some sort of tech wizard to learn how to become a front-end web developer.</p>
    <p><b>Is there anything you have to do at your job that might steer others away?</b> <br>The work that I do can sometimes be very repetitive and boring. Often times when I am making a website, I am repeating alot of the same things over and over and over and for some, that can get really boring really quickly.</p>
    <p><b>Is the web-development market shrinking or growing?</b><br> It is definitely growing. As more people with companies start to move online with their businesses, they need web developers, like me, to create their online presence.</p>
