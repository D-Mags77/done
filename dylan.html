    <p class="picture-paragraph"><img src="DSC00908fb.jpg" alt="photo of me" height="450" width="650">My name is Dylan Magdich. Over the course of my life I have been trying to come up with a career that I feel would best suit me and my skills. Over my research for this project, I have bounced around many ideas such as electrical engineering, computer engineering, and civil engineering. Although these are great career options, I found that web development allows me to be more creative with my work than other jobs, and the fact that I can work from home and don't have to run on a 9-5 schedule means that I am in more control of what I do in life.</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph"><b>Where my passion for computer programming began -</b> My passion for programming started all the way back in 8th grade when I was bored of the stuff we were learning in school. I decided to try and challenge myself by learning a useful life skill. A few Google searches later and I found out about programming. With no plan and a dream I jumped straight into learning about python. Python is a programming language that is very friendly for new learners. It requires very little skill to learn, and with the help of a book called <a class="coding-for-dummies" href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Dummies-Stef-Maruch/dp/0471778648/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3H5HVDA5KEZ50&keywords=coding+for+dummies+python&qid=1647973937&sprefix=coding+for+dummies+%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Python for Dummies</a>, I set out on my journey to learn programming. I soon became very bored of Python because the end product you would get from 50 lines of code would be a text input that would have you enter in what day you were born and then tell you what day of the week you were born on. This hatred of having very little to show for my work is what led me to web development, more specifically, html and css. I made a free account on codeacademy and began learning html and css taking notes in a google doc which I still have to this day. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ebnqMIckAaVb5CKfhbCSCZFbBWwzL7HR4m5LVQ1di88/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" >The Google Doc</a> Since I've started coding I have learned so much about different programming languages and how they all come together to create the digital world we live in today. My hopes in the future are that my love of all things computers will help me to better understand how everything digital in this world works.</p>
