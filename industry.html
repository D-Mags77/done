    <div class="salaries">
        <p>According to the <b>Bueaurea of Labor Statistics</b>, The 2020 median pay for a web developer is $77,200 per year or $37.12 per hour.</p>
        <p>The typical entry-level education is a Bachelor's degree; however, if you are proficient enough at html and css without a degree many companies will still hire you. </p>
        <p>The growth rate of this job is 13% between the years 2020 and 2030 which according to the Beuraue of Labor Statistics is "faster than average" </p>
        <p>Considering that according to <a href="https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/average-american-income/" target="_blank">policyadvice.net</a>, the average median income for a citizen in the United States in 2022 was $51,916.27 a year or $24.52 an hour, being a web-developer can earn you up to 20% more money, and the fact that most companies do not require you to have a degree means you can on average make more money and need to spend less on things like college or coding bootcamps.   </p>

    <p class="fourth-body">The reason as to why the industry is considered endless is because as long as the internet exists, there will always be a market for skilled web developers. Any company you see who has any sort of online presence once needed a web developer to make their website. </p>
